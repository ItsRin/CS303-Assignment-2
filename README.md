# Single Linked List and Employee Classes

This repository contains robust C++ implementations of a `Single_Linked_List` and a hierarchy of `Employee` classes.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Single_Linked_List

- Templated for flexibility: Use with any data type!
- Efficient operations such as `push_front`, `push_back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`, and more.
- Utilities to check if the list is `empty`, `find` an element, `insert` an element at a specific position, and `remove` an element from a specific position.

### Employee Management System

- Abstract `Employee` class that forms the blueprint for all employees.
- Specialized classes for `Professional` and `NonProfessional` employees, each with their logic for calculating salaries, health contributions, and vacation days.
